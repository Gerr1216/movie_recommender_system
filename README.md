The movie recommendation system is designed to suggest movies to users based on the similarity to a given movie title. The system uses cosine similarity to identify and recommend movies that are most similar to the input movie from a curated database.

## Description
The user interface provides an intuitive platform for users to interact with the movie recommendation system. It includes an input field where users can type in the title of the movie they are interested in. Once the movie title is entered, users initiate the recommendation process by clicking a "Recommend" button. The interface then communicates with the backend to process this request and display the results. Users will see a list of recommended movies that are similar to the input title. The design is aimed at being user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience for users seeking movie suggestions.
